Section 5: VIrtual VLAN - VLAN

31. Vlan Types:
        Default Vlan
        Data Vlan
        Voice Vlan
        Management Vlan
        Native Vlan
        
32. Vlan Ranges:
        0,4095 - Reserved (For system use only, we cant see or use these vlans)
        1 - Normal (Default, can use but cant delete)
        2-1001 - Normal (For ethernet vlan. Can use/create/delete these vlans)
        1002 - 1005 - Normal (Cisco default for FDDI and Token ring. cant delete)
        1006 - 4094 - Extended (For ethernet vlans only)
        
 33. creating vlan:
        vlan 10
        name xyz
        
        int fa0/0
        switchport mode access
        switchport access vlan 10
        switchport voice vlan 20
        
******** a switch port cant be part of more than one data/voice vlan


Section 6: Trunking Concepts

38.
* switch - switch : cross cabling, known as uplinks (high speed link)
* A single vlan can span over two or more switches within the lan

39.
Vlan-Trunk Links: Trunk is a point to point link bw 2 network devices. All vlan traffic will pass through this single link. 
                  Supports Fa/Gig/10-gig 
                  
40. Access link Trunk link:
                Trunk link carry traffic from multiple vlans.
                
41. 802.3 Ethernet Frame Format:
                Preamble
                Dest Addr
                Src Addr
                Type
                Data/Payload
                FCS
                
42. Frame tagging:
               Tagging ethernet frames for vlan identification
               Tag is added before a frame is send and removed once it is received on trunk link
