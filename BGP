BGP maintain 3 tables:
  Loop prevention mechanism in BGP:
     route learned by ibgp is not forwaded to next ibgp neigh to prevent loop
     1) Full Mesh 
     2) Route Reflector
     3) Confederation
  
  
Table
  1) Neigh (sh ip bgp summ)
  2) BGP - contains best route from neigh with attributes (sh ip bgp) * - valid route, > - Best Path
  3) Routing (sh ip route bgp) 
  
sh tcp brief
    server-client relationship
    Jo connection initiate karta hai is client and the one who reply back is server (179)
    If connection is initiated at same time then higher router id will become client
 
  
  EBGP - By default, we can create neigh relationship only with directly connected router as TTL value in TCP packet is 1
         ebgp multihop & TTL Security : We can increase TTL value
         disable connected check : command we use when we are sure that next router hi hai. Here, also TTL value is 1
         
         router bgp 200
         neigh 4.4.4.4 update-source lo 5  (To update the exit interface)
         
         ebgp multihop: 
                router bgp 100
                neigh 5.5.5.5 ebgp-multihop 3
         ttl security (it controls incoming traffic as well)
                router bgp 100
                neigh 5.5.5.5 ttl-security hops 3
                
                
         
         
  BGP Best Path selection:
  Best path selection prerequisites:
  
  Best path selection order:
  
  BGP uses attribute to decide the best path.
  
  BGP Path categories: 1)Well-Known Mandatory - Origin, AS_Path, Next_HOP
                       2)Well-Known discretionary - Locl_Pref, Atomic_Aggregate
                       3)Optional transitive - Aggregator, Community
                       4)Optional non-transitive - MED, Originator_ID, Cluster list, Multiprotocol Reachable NLRI, Multiprotocol Unreachable NLRI
                       
                       BGP weight attribute
      Checking Order                 
         1) Weight
         2) Local Pref
         3) Locally Orginated (gets weight of 32768)
         4) AS-Path
         5) Origin (I>E>?)  I - network stat, ? - Redistribute
         6) MED - 
         7) EBGP over IBGP
         8) IGP Metric to Next-HOP
